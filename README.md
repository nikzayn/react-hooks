# In this project, I have learned more about the new features in reactjs which are react hooks.
# I have learn some concepts of useState() and useEffect().
# This project gives the brief idea to use the functional components in more better way than the class based components

## At present, only the absolute latest version of React has access to hooks.  Create React App does not install the correct version right now.

You must run this command in your terminal to get hooks to run correctly:

### `npm install --save react@next react-dom@next`
